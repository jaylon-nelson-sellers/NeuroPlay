# High Level Goals

## Understand and Implement Games
Starting from least to most complex, the design for the board games will be created. A inheritable game object would be ideal.
Games
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect 4
- Battleship
- Gomoku
- Chess
- Risk

## Code using Model-View-Controller Pattern
The code should have Low Coupling, High Cohesion. It should adhere to the model view controller pattern.

## Implement Bots
Researching, Implementing, Training, Tweaking, Testing the bots. The bots will be trained on a genetic algorithm

## Create and store data (Important!)
Once a stable release of the program is created, it will record and store important information such as Elo (how strong the bot is), training time, parameters, etc
Strong bots will be saved to be trained and played against each other.

## Produce an Exceptional Write up of the project
Finalize and check data, cite sources, and produce a dissertion style write up of the project.
